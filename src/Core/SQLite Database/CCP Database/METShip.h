	 Query:

	 SELECT at.graphicID, at.attributeID, at.displayName, ta.valueInt, ta.valueFloat
	 FROM dgmTypeAttributes ta, dgmAttributeTypes at
	 WHERE at.attributeID = ta.attributeID
	 AND ta.typeID = 639


	 Gives the attributes needed to display info about a ship

	 Plan:

	 Issue the query to get all the identifiers and stuff everything into a NSDictionary
	 keyed on the attributeID, and fetch the attribute ID data as required.
