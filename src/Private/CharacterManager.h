 This factory class is designed to create immutable character objects.
 They are immutable in the sense that they cannot be "updated".  that is
 the XML sheets cannot be updated / redownloaded by the character class.
 (in other words, any data obtained from the API server)

 It is however valid to mess with the skill plans, ship fitouts or any other
 data managed by the character object.

 Maintains a list of ACTIVE characters only.  We don't care about inactive
 characters.

 Implements tableview delegates & datasource methods for the character overview
 display.
